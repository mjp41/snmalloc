# Release 0.7.0

The latest release of `snmalloc` has a few interesting features that are worth discussing in more detail.
Primarily this release focuses on improving the performance of `snmalloc` in a few key areas.
But we have also added some new features to build new security features on top of `snmalloc`.

We provide three short write-ups of the key changes in the release:

* [Start-up performance](startup.md)
* [BatchIt](batchit.md)
* [Custom meta-data](custommetadata.md)
